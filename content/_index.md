        I am an AI researcher focusing on **Anomaly Detection**, **XR Simulation**, and **Generative AI for Content Creation**.  

        My work aims to build robust systems that detect abnormal events in complex environments, such as autonomous driving scenarios and industrial applications. I also explore XR-based training platforms and develop generative models to create interactive content for virtual simulations and educational tools.  

        I am passionate about applying AI to real-world challenges by combining multimodal data, immersive technologies, and creative automation.  

        Feel free to reach out for collaborations! ü§ù
