This project introduces an **explainable anomaly detection framework** for road environments, focusing on the safety of autonomous driving systems. By leveraging **pixel-wise logit variance** and **uncertainty estimation**, the system effectively identifies road hazards such as debris, potholes, and unexpected obstacles.

### ðŸš€ Key Contributions:
- **Uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation** to highlight abnormal regions in road scenes.
- Iterative background refinement to enhance the precision of hazard boundaries.
- Practical deployment on dashcam video datasets for real-world evaluation.
- Proposed a novel metric for assessing pixel-level risk factors in unseen environments.

### ðŸ“Œ Publications:
- ** Road anomaly segmentation based on pixel-wise logit variance with iterative background highlighting.**
