Collaborated with Seoul City University, and industry partners to build a large-scale benchmark dataset for AI safety evaluation.  
This dataset covers **35 categories of AI-related risks** with **11,480 multimodal instances** (text, image, video, audio).  

Our lab contributed to the development of **risk data for image and video modalities**, ensuring high-quality, ethically curated datasets for generative AI safety evaluation.
