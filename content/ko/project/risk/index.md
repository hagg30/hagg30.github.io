Pixelâ€‘wise logit variance drives a segmentation network that spots debris and potholes while quantifying risk for autonomous vehicles.

**Highlights**
- Uncertaintyâ€‘aware segmentation improves average precision by 21.7% 
- Iterative background refinement sharpens hazard edges  
- Benchâ€‘tested on 180Â k Korean dashâ€‘cam frames; 45Â FPS on RTXÂ A6000
